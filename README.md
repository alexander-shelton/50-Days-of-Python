# 50 Days of Python

My **50 Days of Python** journey.

This project is a daily coding challenge that was designed to help you improve Python skills through hands-on exercises and projects.

Each day features a new topic or problem to solve, ranging from basic syntax to advanced concepts.

I did not create this challenge; I am simply participating in it.
