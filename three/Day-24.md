# Day 24:  Average Calories  

Write a function called `average_calories` that calculates the
average calorie intake of a user. The function should ask the user to
input their calorie intake for **any** number of days, and once they hit
"done," it should calculate and **return** the average intake.

## Extra Challenge:  Create a Nested List

Write a function called `nested_lists` that takes any number of lists
and creates a 2-dimensional nested list of lists. Your code must
check that the inputs are of the list data type. For example, if you
pass the following lists as arguments:
**\[1, 2, 3, 5], \[1, 2, 3, 4], \[1, 3, 4, 5]**.
Your code should return: **\[\[1, 2, 3, 5], \[1, 2, 3, 4], \[1, 3, 4, 5]]**

If you pass: **(1, 2, 3, 5), \[1, 2, 3, 4], \[1, 3, 4, 5]** as arguments,
your function should return
**"Invalid arguments. Please check your arguments."**
