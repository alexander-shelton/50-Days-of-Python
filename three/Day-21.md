# Day 21:  List of Tuples  

Write a function called `make_tuples` that takes **two equal** lists
and combines them into a list of tuples. Your code should check that the input lists are of the same length. For example, if list a is `[1, 2, 3, 4]` and list b is `[5, 6, 7, 8]`, your function should return `[(1, 5), (2,  6), (3,  7), (4, 8)]`. If the lists are not of equal length, your function should raise a **ValueError**.

## Extra Challenge:  Even Number or Average  

Write a function called `even_or_average` that asks a user to
input five numbers. Once the user is done, the code should
return the largest even number in the inputted numbers.
If there is no even number in the list, the code should return
the average of all the five numbers.
