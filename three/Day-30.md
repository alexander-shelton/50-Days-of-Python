# Day 30: Most Repeated Name  

Write a function called `repeated_name` that finds the most
repeated name in the following list. Your function should return a
tuple of the name and how many times it appears. The list below
should return: ("Peter", 3).

```python
name = ["John", "Peter", "John", "Peter", "Jones", "Peter"]
```

## Extra Challenge: Sort by Last Name  

You work for a local school in your area. The school has a list of
names of students saved in a list format. The school has asked you
to write a program that takes a list of names and sorts them
alphabetically. The names should be sorted by last name. Here is
a list of names:  

```python
["Beyonc√©  Knowles", "Alicia Keys", "Katie Perry", "Chris Brown", "Tom Cruise"]
```

Your code should not just sort them alphabetically; it should also
switch the names (the last name must be the first). Here is how
your code output should look:  

```python
['Brown Chris', 'Cruise Tom', 'Keys Alicia', 'Knowles Beyonce', 'Perry Katie']
```

Write a function called `sorted_names`.
