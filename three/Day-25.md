# Day 25: All the Same  

Write a function called `all_the_same` that takes one argument, a **string**, a **list**, or a **tuple**, and checks if all the elements are the same. Use the **instance** function to check that the input data is either a **string**, a **list**, or a **tuple**, or else raise a **TypeError** that says that **"Input must be a string, a list, or a tuple."** If the elements are the same, the function should return **True**. If not, it should return **False**. For example, **\["Mary", "Mary", "Mary"]** should return **True**.

## Extra Challenge:  Reverse a String

```python
str1 = "the love is real"
```

Write a function called `read_backwards` that takes a string as
an argument and reverses it. The string above, for example, should
return: **"real is love the."**
