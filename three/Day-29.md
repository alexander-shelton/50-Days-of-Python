# Day 29:  Middle Figure  

Write a function called `middle_figure` that has two
parameters, **a** and **b**. The **two** parameters are strings. The
function joins the two strings and finds the middle element.
If the combined string has a middle element, the function
should return the element; otherwise, it should return **"no
middle figure."** Use **"make love"** as an argument for **a**, and
**"not wars"** as an argument for **b**. Your function should
return "e" as the middle element. Whitespaces should be
removed.
