# Day 11: Are They Equal?

Write a function called `equal_strings`. The function takes
two strings as arguments and compares them. If the strings
are equal (if they have the same characters and have equal
length), it should return __True__; if they are not, it should
return __False__. For example, __"love"__ and __"evol"__ should
return __True.__

## Extra Challenge: Swap Values

Write a function called `swap_values`. This function takes
a list of numbers and swaps the first element with the last
element. For example, if you pass __\[2, 4, 67, 7]__ as a
argument, your function should return.
__\[7, 4, 67, 2].__
