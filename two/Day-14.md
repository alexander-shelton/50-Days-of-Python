# Day 14: Flatten the List

Write a function called `flat_list` that takes one argument, a nested
list. The function converts the nested list into a one-dimensional
list. For example, __\[\[2, 4, 5, 6]]__ should return __\[2, 4, 5, 6]__.

## Extra Challenge: Teacher’s Salary

A school has asked you to write a program that will calculate
teachers' salaries. The program should ask the user to enter the
teacher’s __name__, the __number of periods__ taught in a month, and
the __rate__ per period. The monthly salary is calculated by
multiplying the __number of periods__ by the __monthly rate__. The
current monthly rate per period is $20. If a teacher has more than
100 periods in a month, everything above 100 is overtime.
Overtime is $25 per period. For example, if a teacher has taught
__105__ periods, their gross monthly salary should be __$2,125__. Write
a function called `your_salary` that calculates a teacher’s gross
salary. The function should return the __teacher’s name, periods__
__taught__, and __gross salary__. Here is how you should format your
output:

```python
Teacher: John Kelly,  
Periods: 105  
Gross salary:2,125 
```
