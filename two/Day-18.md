# Day 18:  Any Number of Arguments  

Write a function `called_any_number` that can receive any
number of positional arguments ( integers  and floats ) and return
the average of those integers.  If you pass **12, 90, 12 and 34** as
arguments , your function should return **37.0**  as the average. If you
pass **12 and 90**, your function should return **51.0**  as  the average.  

## Extra Challenge:  Add and Reverse  

Write a function called `add_reverse`. This function takes two lists as arguments, adds each corresponding number, and reverses the outcome. For example, if you pass **\[10, 12, 34]** and **\[12, 56, 78]**, your code should return **\[112, 22, 68]**. If the two lists are not of equal length, the code should return a message that **"The lists are not of equal length."**
