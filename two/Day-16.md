# Day 16:  Sum the List  

Write  a function called `sum_list`  with one parameter that takes a
nested list of integers as an argument and returns the sum of the
integers. For example, if you pass __\[\[2, 4, 5, 6], \[2, 3, 5, 6] ]__ as an
argument , your function should return a sum of __33__.

## Extra Challenge:  Unpack A Nest  

```python
nested_list = [[12, 34, 56, 67], [34, 68, 78]]
```

Write a code  that generates  a list of the following numbers from
the nested list above : __34, 67, 78__.  Your output  should be  another
list: __\[34, 67, 78]__. The list output should not have duplicates.
