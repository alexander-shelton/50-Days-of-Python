# Day 13: Pay Your Tax

Write a function called `your_vat`. The function has no
parameters. The function asks the user to input the price of an
item and VAT (VAT should be a percentage). The function should
return the price of the item plus VAT. If the price is 220 and the
VAT is 15%, your code should return a VAT-inclusive price of 253.
Check to see if your code can handle **ValueError** and negative
inputs from the user. Ensure the code runs until valid numbers
are entered.
> (Hint: Your code should include a while loop.)

## Extra Challenge: Pyramid of Snakes

Write a function called `python_snakes` that takes a number as
an argument and creates the pyramid shape using the number’s
range. (Hint: Use the loops and emoji libraries for snake emojis.)
If you pass 7 as an argument, your code should print the
following:
