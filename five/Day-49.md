# Day 49: Create a Database

For this challenge, you are going to create a **database** using Pythonâ€™s SQLLite. You will **import SQLLite** into your script. Create
a database called **movies.db**. In that database, you are going to
create a table called **"movies."** In that table, you are going to save
the following movies:

| year | title       | genre   |
|------|-------------|---------|
| 2009 | Brothers    | Drama   |
| 2002 | Spider Man  | Sci-fi  |
| 2009 | WatchMen    | Drama   |
| 2010 | Inception   | Sci-fi  |
| 2009 | Avatar      | Fantasy |

1) Once you create a table, run a SQL query to see all the
movies in your table.
2) Run another SQL query to select only the movie Brothers
from the list.
3) Run another SQL query to select all movies that were
released in 2009 from your table.
4) Run another query to select movies in the fantasy and
drama genres.
5) Run a query to delete all the contents of your table.
