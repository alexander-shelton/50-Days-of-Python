# Day 44: Save Emails

Create a function called `save_emails`. This function takes no arguments but asks the user to input an email, and it saves the emails in a CSV file. The user can input as many emails as they want. Once they hit "done," the function saves the emails and closes the file. Create another function called `open_emails`. This function opens and reads the content of the CSV file. Each email requires its own line. Here is an example of how the emails must be saved:

```python
jj@gmail.com
kate@yahoo.com
```

and not like this:
`jj@gmail.com kate@yahoo.com`
