# Day 42: Spelling Checker  

Write a function called `spelling_checker`. This code asks the user to input a word, and if the user inputs the wrong spelling, it should suggest the **correct spelling** by asking the user if they meant to type that word. If the user says no, it should ask the user to enter the word again. If the user says yes, it should return the correct word. If the word entered by the user is correctly spelled, the function should return the correct word. Use the **module textblob**.  

## Extra Challenge: Set Alarm

Write a function called `set_alarm` that sets an alarm clock for the user. The function should ask the user to enter the time they want the alarm to go off. The user should enter the time in hours and minutes. The function should ensure that the user enters valid inputs for hour and minutes. The function should run until the user enters valid input. Once the user enters valid inputs, the function should then print out the time when the alarm will go off. When it's alarm time, the code should let off a sound. Use the `winsound` module for sound.
