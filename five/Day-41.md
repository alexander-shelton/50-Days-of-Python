# Day 41: Only Words with Vowels  

Create a function called `words_with_vowels`. This function takes a string of words and returns a list of only the words that have vowels in them. **"You have no rhythm,"** for example, should return **["you" "have" "no"]**.

## Extra Challenge: Class of Cars

Create three classes for three car brands: **Ford**, **BMW**, and **Tesla**. The instance attributes of the car's objects will be model, color, year, transmission, and whether the car is electric or not (a Boolean value). Consider using inheritance in your answer.  
You will create one object for each car brand:  

**bmw1**: **model**: x6, **Color**: silver, **Year**:  2018, **Transmission**: Auto, **Electric**: False  
**tesla1**: **model**: S, **Color**: beige, **Year**:  2017, **Transmission**: Auto, **Electric**: True  
**ford1**: **model**: focus, **Color**: white, **Year**:  2020, **Transmission**: Auto, **Electric**: False  

You will create an **instance method** called `print_cars` that will
be able to print out objects of the class. For example, if you call the
method on the **ford1** object of the Ford class, your function should
be able to print out **car info** in this exact format:

```python
car_model = focus  
Color = White  
Year = 2020  
Transmission = Auto  
Electric = False
```
