# Day 8: Odd and Even

Write a function called `odd_even` that has one parameter and takes a list of numbers as an argument. The function returns the difference between the largest even number in the list and the smallest odd number in the list. For example, if you pass __\[1, 2, 4, 6]__ as an argument, the function should return __6 - 1= 5__.

## Extra Challenge: List of Prime Numbers

Write a function called `prime_numbers`. This function asks the user to enter a number (an integer) as an argument and returns a list of all the prime numbers within its range. For example, if the user enters 10, your code should return __\[2, 3, 5, 7]__ as prime numbers.
