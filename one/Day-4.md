# Day 4: Only Floats

Write a function called `only_floats`, which has two parameters, **a** and **b**, and returns **2** if both arguments are floats, **1** if only one argument is a **float**, and **0** if neither argument is a float. If you pass **(12.1, 23)** as an argument, your function should return **1**.

## Extra Challenge: Index of the Longest Word

Write a function called `word_index` that takes one argument, a **list** of strings, and returns the **index** of the longest word in the list. If there is no longest word (if all the strings are of the same length), the function should return zero **(0)**. For example, the first list below should return **2**.

```Python
words1 = ["Hate", "remorse", "vengeance"]
# And this list below, should return zero (0) 
words2 = ["Love", "Hate"]
```
