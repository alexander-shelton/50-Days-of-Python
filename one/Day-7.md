# Day 7: A String Range

Write a function called `string_range` that takes a single number and returns a string of its range.

The string characters should be __separated by dots(.)__.

For example, if you pass __6__ as an argument, your function should return __"0.1.2.3.4.5"__.

## Extra Challenge: Dictionary of Names

You are given a list of names, and you are asked to write a code that returns all the names that start with "S."

Your code should return a dictionary of all the names that start with *S* and how many times they appear in the dictionary.

Here is a list below:

```python
names = [
  "Joseph", "Nathan", "Sasha", "Kelly", 
  "Muhammad", "Jabulani", "Sera", "Patel", "Sera"
] 
```

Your code should return: __{"Sasha": 1, "Sera": 2}__
