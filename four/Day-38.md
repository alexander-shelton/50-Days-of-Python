# Day 38: Guess a Number  

Write a function called `guess_a_number` . The function should ask a user to guess a randomly generated number. If the user guesses a higher number, the code should tell them that the guess is too high; if the user guesses a low number, the code should tell them that their guess is too low. The user should get a maximum of **three (3)** guesses. When the user guesses right, the code should declare them a winner. After three wrong guesses, the code should declare them losers.

## Extra Challenge: Find Missing Numbers  

```python
list1 = [1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, 11, 12, 23, 14, 15, 17,  
            18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 31]  
```

Write a function called `missing_numbers` that takes a list of sequence of numbers as argument, and finds the missing numbers in the sequence.  The list above should return :

```python
[4, 8, 10, 13, 16, 29, 30]
```
