# Day 40: Pig Latin  

Write a function called `translate` that takes the following words and translates them into Pig Latin.

```python
my_string = "i love python"
```

Here are the rules:

1. If a word starts with a **vowel (a,  e, i, o , u)** add **"yay"** at
the end. For example, **"eat"** will become **"eatyay"**
2. If a word starts with anything other than a vowel, move the first letter to the end and add **'ay'** to the end. For example, **"day"** will become **"ayday."**

Your code should return:

```python
"iyay ovelay ythonpay"
```
