# Day 31:  Longest Word  

Write a function that has one parameter and takes a list of words as an argument. The function returns the longest word from the list. Name the function `longest_word`. The function should return the longest word and the number of letters in that word. For example, if you pass **['Java ', 'JavaScript ', 'Python ']**, your function should return **[10, JavaScript]** as the longest word.  

## Extra Challenge:  Create User  

Write a function called `create_user`. This function asks the user to enter their name, age, and password. The function saves this information in a dictionary. For example, if the user enters Peter as his name, 18 as his age, and "love" as his password, the function should save the information as: **{"name": "Peter", "age": "18", "password": "love"}**. Once the information is saved, the function should print to the user, "User saved. Please login" The function should then ask the user to re-enter their name and password. If the name and password match what is saved in the dictionary, the function should return **"Logged in successfully."**  If the name and password do not match what is saved in the dictionary, the function should print **"Wrong password or user name, please try again"**.  The function should keep running until the user enters the correct logging details.
